# Purpose & Goal = Why we built this system
- Brief introduction to GenWell: GenWell is dedicated to making the world a happier and healthier place by addressing the
issues of disconnection, isolation, and loneliness. 
- Seniors AI is a Python-based tool designed to analyze loneliness related data of older adults (aged 65+). It analyzes and visualizes senior well-being data, as well as featuring GenWell 2024 Cross-Sectional Data collection, analysis, visualization, and benchmarking capabilities.
- In addition, we want to enhance our understanding of Python and learn new skills beyond CSCA20.

# Potential Use Cases
1. Healthcare Providers: Detect seniors at risk of social isolation or health decline based on loneliness data.
2. Community Organizations (like GenWell): Target interventions for the most vulnerable demographics.
3. Family Members/Caregivers: Monitor and understand a loved one's social and health trends & compare it to GenWell's data.
